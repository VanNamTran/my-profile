                  Survivorship bias is a psychological phenomenon that frequently
                  affects how we perceive success and failure in life. When
                  evaluating situations, you might focus only on success stories
                  while overlooking unrecorded failures. Understanding survivorship
                  bias and how it distorts perception can help you gain a more
                  comprehensive view of reality. In this article, we will explore
                  the concept of survivorship bias, clarify how it impacts our
                  judgments, and provide methods to avoid falling into this
                  cognitive trap, enabling you to make more accurate and thoughtful
                  decisions.

              <p data-translate="survivorshipBiasDescription">
                  Survivorship bias is a type of bias that occurs when one focuses
                  only on individuals or objects that have "survived" a selection
                  process, while ignoring those that have failed or no longer exist.
                  This leads to a distorted view of the overall picture and can
                  result in inaccurate conclusions.

                  <b>Example of Vintage Motorcycles:</b> Many people view vintage
                  motorcycles from past decades as symbols of quality and durability
                  because some of them are still functioning well after many years.
                  However, this perception may be the result of survivorship bias,
                  as only the motorcycles that were well-maintained and fortunate
                  enough to avoid major issues have survived to this day. Thousands
                  of other motorcycles that broke down, were not properly
                  maintained, or were discarded never had the chance to demonstrate
                  their "quality."

Survivorship bias in this context can lead to an overreliance on certain health practices or lifestyle choices without considering other factors such as genetics or luck.

                  Survivorship bias is a common phenomenon that affects how we perceive and evaluate success and failure in many areas of life. From startups, investments, to success stories on social media and health decisions, this bias can lead to misguided judgments and unrealistic expectations. To avoid falling into the trap of survivorship bias, we need to take a comprehensive view of both successes and failures, while thoroughly analyzing the factors that influence outcomes. Only then can we make informed and well-considered decisions in both work and everyday life. I hope you find this article helpful. For more topics, don't miss the updates on my blog.
