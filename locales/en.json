"start_topic_cc_bcc_email":"Email communication is an essential part of both professional and personal interactions. While composing an email, you might have noticed different fields labeled 'To', 'CC' và 'BCC'. Understanding the purpose and proper usage of these fields can significantly impact the clarity and confidentiality of your communication. In this article, we will explore the differences between 'To', 'CC' và 'BCC', and provide insights into when and how to use each option effectively to ensure your message is delivered to the right recipients in the most appropriate manner."
,    "emailDifferencesTitle": "The differences between To, CC, and BCC when sending email?",
"exampleExplanation": "Let me give you an example as illustrated below."
,"emailExample": "Suppose you are the boy in the blue shirt. When you send an email, there are three groups of recipients: 'To' for those in the yellow area, 'CC' for those in the blue area, and 'BCC' for those in the pink area.",
  "emailVisibility": "Recipients in the 'To' field will see all other recipients in the 'To' and 'CC' fields. Recipients in the 'CC' field will also see all other recipients in the 'To' and 'CC' fields. This means that everyone in the 'To' and 'CC' fields can see each other. However, recipients in the 'BCC' field, those at the back, will see all recipients in the 'To' and 'CC' fields but will not see other recipients in the 'BCC' field because they are hidden from each other. Conversely, those in the 'To' and 'CC' fields at the front will not see those who are in the 'BCC' field at the back.",

  "ccField": "CC (Carbon Copy)",
  "ccDescription": "Secondary recipient: Use the 'CC' field for secondary recipients who need to be informed of the email's content but do not need to respond or take action. This field is primarily for keeping people in the loop.",
